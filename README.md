Project 2: Building a Business Chatbot
Objective:
To create a Python-based chatbot capable of automating customer support, handling FAQs, and engaging in basic conversations.

Approach:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset of customer inquiries from Kaggle or GitHub to train the chatbot.
Natural Language Processing:
Tokenization: Break down user input into individual words or tokens.
Preprocessing: Clean the text by removing stop words, stemming, or lemmatizing.
Similarity-Based Response:
Use techniques like cosine similarity to match user queries with the most relevant responses from the dataset.
Chatbot Interface:
Develop a user-friendly interface (e.g., text-based or GUI) for interaction.
Implement a conversation flow to handle user queries and provide appropriate responses.
